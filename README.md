## Intro

The goal of this package is to provide management tools related to Python
virtual environments. Currently this package expects a current installation of
[virtualenvwrapper](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper). If you use
virtualenv in a different setup please
[let me know what that is](https://github.com/jhutchins/virtualenv/issues/new)
as I would love to support it.

This is part of a longer term personal goal of mine to make
atom the best full fledged Python IDE ever. To that end any and all feedback on
this package is appreciated. If there is something that is doesn't do that you
would like it to or if it doesn't work as advertised for your particular setup
please
[file a bug](https://github.com/jhutchins/virtualenv/issues/new).

## Features

* View currently selected environment in the status bar
* Activate a different environment

## Future

The following are all things I'd like to add to atom, but they may not all end
up as part of this tool.

* Make a new environment
* Deactivate an environment
* pip package manager
* Auto dep tool for setup.py
